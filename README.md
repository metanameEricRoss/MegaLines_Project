## Breakdown 
This Repo is for a Telecome Data Analysis Project from my Data Science course.  
This project aims to analyze the usage and charges of 500 customers from the year 2018 for MegaLines Telecom. The objective is to assist the marketing team in determining which of the company's two plans is the most profitable.

By examining the data, we aim to gain valuable insights into the value and effectiveness of each plan. These insights will provide valuable guidance for a new marketing campaign, helping MegaLines Telecom make informed decisions to optimize their services and maximize profitability.
## Methods and Goals to work on improving 

In order to refine my understanding and gauge how I have improved working with the topic listed below. 

- Pandas/ Pivot Tables; grouping, summarizing, aggregating, and calculating statistics. 
- Matplotlib & Seaborn / EDA; mostly comparative analysis of the two plans revenue. 
- Hypothesis Testing; Which plan is more profitable for the company?

## Quick Overveiw: Libraries, Charts, and Conclusions. 
... This project is an ongoing endeavor, with me diligently working to enhance my skills, gain valuable insights, and continually improve the analysis process.
